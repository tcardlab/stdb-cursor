## STDB Typescript Demo

This branch demonstrates how some fringe use-cases lead to
`TableClass` â‰  `typeof TableClass`.
I don't know if this is intentional by TS or if it is simply struggling to infer types vs values of passed classes.

For the most part, `InstanceType<typeof TableClass>` can solve the issue.
